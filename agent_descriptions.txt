Single transformation agents (Only consider actions that are different between the paths in order they occur):
Agent, P(X=x|Y) = max(P(X=y|Y)) for all y in Y where Y is a subset of L (language)
UnaryProbAgent, P(X=x|Y) = dist[x] / sum(dist[Y]) where Y is a subset of L (language), dist[y] = randint(0,100)
StocasticAgent, P(X=x|Y) = 1 / |Y| where Y is a subset of L (language)

Multi-transformation agent (Consider whole path) n.b E = actual provenance path,P = possible prov paths:
IndependentActionsAgent (IndActAgent), P('action') are independent
BinaryCovarianceRelationAgent (BinCovAgent), P('xy') = cov(x,y)
